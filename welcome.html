    <h1 align="center">Welcome to the family!</h1>
    <p align="center">Based on your answers to the questionnaire, it has been decided that you are best suited for guest work in Nuevo Mexicali, Mandalore! Your duties will include field work at a starting salary of $1310.40 per year! What a momentous occasion this must be for you! Before we can finalize your guest work application we must inform you that all family members and material wealth you have must be left on Earth. Before processing you will be required to bring no more than 100 pesos, or $5.30 with you to Mandalore. Your clothing must be pure cotton and without blemish. Before and after each work day on Mandalore you will be required to go through detoxification where you will be doused with DDT, a harmless purification agent for the safety of your employers and fellow residents on Mandalore. All tools will be provided on hourly rentals with varying costs based on the discretion of your chosen employer.
